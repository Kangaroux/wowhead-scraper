# Wowhead Scraper

Work in progress!

The scraper visits an NPC page on Wowhead, then scrapes the loot from drops, skinning, and pickpocketing, as well as some basic info about the NPC. The scraper was built for Classic but it probably works on the retail site.

The motivation behind this is to provide a resource that private server owners can use to align their loot tables to be Blizzlike.
